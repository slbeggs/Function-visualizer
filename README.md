# Function-visualizer
The function Visualizer is a Unity-based application that enables users to visualize various mathematical functions in 3D space. The user has the flexibility to choose from a list of predefined functions or input their own custom function. Furthermore, the application provides a user-friendly camera control mechanism to rotate around the graph and zoom in/out for an enhanced visualization experience.

#Use Cases
The Graph Visualizer can be a powerful tool for a range of users:

Educators: Use it as a teaching aid to help students visualize complex mathematical concepts.

Students: Use it as a learning tool to better understand and explore mathematical functions.

Researchers: Employ it as a quick visualization tool for exploring and understanding mathematical models and relationships.

# Visualization of Functions: Diverse Surfaces
The Graph Visualizer is not just limited to showcasing functions in standard graph formats. It offers a rich visual experience by representing functions across various types of surfaces. These representations can provide deep insights into the nature and interactions of mathematical functions:

# 1D Surfaces
The simplest representation is along a single dimension:

# Sine Function:
A classic wave pattern along the X-axis, this representation showcases the regular oscillations of the sine wave.

# MultiSine Function:
A combination of multiple sine waves that vary in frequency and amplitude, offering a richer, more intricate wave pattern than the standard sine.

# 2D Surfaces
The functions can be extended across two dimensions, creating patterns across a plane:

# 2DSine:
A combination of sine waves along both the x and z axes, this visualization produces a ripple-like "terrain" across a 3D plane, where the 'y' value changes based on the interaction of the sine functions from x and z.
