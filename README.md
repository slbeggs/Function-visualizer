# Visualization of Functions: Diverse Surfaces
The function  Visualizer is not just limited to showcasing functions in standard graph formats. It offers a rich visual experience by representing functions across various types of surfaces.Users can gain an intuitive understanding of mathematical concepts by seeing them come alive across different visual terrains. These representations can provide deep insights into the nature and interactions of mathematical functions.  Whether you're exploring simple waveforms or intricate patterns, the Graph Visualizer offers a canvas that adapts to your needs.

# 1D Surfaces
The simplest representation is along a single dimension:

# Sine Function:
A classic wave pattern along the X-axis, this representation showcases the regular oscillations of the sine wave.

# 2D Surfaces
The functions can be extended across two dimensions, creating patterns across a plane:

# 2DSine:
A combination of sine waves along both the x and z axes, this visualization produces a ripple-like "terrain" across a 3D plane, where the 'y' value changes based on the interaction of the sine functions from x and z.

# Custom Functions
Beyond the predefined functions, Graph Visualizer stands out with its ability to allow users to input and visualize their custom functions:

Flexible Input: Users can input their mathematical functions using standard mathematical notation, making it easy to translate mathematical ideas into visual forms.

Error Handling: The system checks for errors in the user's input, ensuring that only valid functions are plotted.

Dynamic Visualization: As users input their function, the Graph Visualizer dynamically updates the visual representation, providing instant feedback and making the exploration of functions a fluid experience.

# Interaction and Exploration
The Graph Visualizer isn't just about passive observation. It's an interactive tool that allows users to:

Rotate and Zoom: Users can rotate the visualization in 3D space to view it from different angles, and zoom in or out to focus on specific details or to get a broader overview.

Time Evolution: Some functions are time-dependent. With Graph Visualizer, these functions come alive, evolving over time and showcasing dynamic patterns and behaviors.

Color Mapping: The visualizations can be enhanced further using color mapping based on function values, gradients, or other parameters. This not only makes the visuals more appealing but can also provide deeper insights into the nature and behavior of functions

# How to Use
Start the application: Launch the Unity project and hit the Play button.
Select a function: Use the GUI dropdown menu to select one of the predefined functions or Input custom function.
Rotate the graph: Click and drag the mouse to rotate around the graph.
